
Eurostat RDF files in a box
===========================

To run:

1.  Look in eurostat.cfg and create the directory that is listed in the
    [sources] section. It is probably "sdmxfiles".

2.  python downloadsdmx.py will download all the datasets you don't have or
    are newer than your local copy. It will first download the table of contents
    in XML. (Can be turned off in eurostat.cfg)

3.  Run dic2rdf.py to create the dictionaries. It will download the all_dic.zip.
    (Can be turned off in eurostat.cfg)

4.  Run property2rdf to create the property vocabulary

5.  Run sdmx2rdf.py -- If given no arguments it will build RDF for
    all datasets listed in dic/en/table_dic.dic if the RDF is older than
    the SDMX.

6.  Run voidwriter.py to create the void.rdf file. You might have to install
    libxslt-python. The script uses the table of contents and all_dic.zip that
    were downloaded in step 2 and 3.

Additionally:

7. There are metadata files in Eurostat. These can be downloaded with downloadesms.py

8. Then you can create RDF of them with esms2rdf.py
